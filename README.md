* [Wild Magic Util](./wild-magic) : a util for determining if wild magic happens for wile magic sorcerers using my homebrew wilde magic rule: depending on the sorcerer level of the PC there is a percent chance that wild magic happens. The percent chance is decreased the higher sorcerer level of the PC.
